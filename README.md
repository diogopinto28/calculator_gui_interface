# calculator Gui Interface

Super basic calculator made with Python used as a learning project!

I used tkinter gui to remake my fisrt Python project (https://github.com/diogopinto28/calc) with some extras and a GUI interface. 

Firt time using Tkinter and the code, as far as I'm concerned, has no bugs, but it could tottaly be done at a more experienced level of coding. 

If you have any suggestion on how I could improve my code ,contact me, so I can learn with you :) !
